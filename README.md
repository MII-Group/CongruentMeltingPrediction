# CongruentMeltingPrediction
 
**congruentMeltingPrediction.ipynb**: Machine learning model training and evaluation code.

**data.csv**: data file contains alloy composition, physical and chemical features. Original file contains melting reaction type(Congruent, incongruent), but this file does not since it requires the permission from ASM Alloy Phase Diagram Database.
